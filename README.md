## Our Mission

OpenExam is an open-source project committed to building a secure, transparent, and accessible online examination platform for India. We aim to eliminate exam paper leaks, promote academic integrity, and create equal opportunities for all students.

## The Problem

Exam paper leaks are a persistent issue in India, undermining the education system and causing significant distress to students. Traditional exam methods are vulnerable to security breaches and lack transparency.

## Our Solution

OpenExam will provide a robust online examination platform with the following features:

* **Secure Question Bank:**  Dynamically generated exams from a vast, encrypted question database, minimizing the impact of leaks.
* **Tamper-Proof Delivery:**  End-to-end encryption and a distributed network to prevent unauthorized access during exam delivery.
* **Advanced Proctoring:** AI-powered proctoring tools including live video monitoring, keystroke analysis, and screen sharing to detect cheating attempts.
* **Open Source and Auditable:**  Transparency and community-driven development ensure the platform's security and integrity.

## Technologies - Build It Your Way!
